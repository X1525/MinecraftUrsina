# MinecraftUrsina
A simple(ish) minecraft recreation with the ursina engine.

Notes:

/----------------------------------------\
| You need to have the ursina package to |
| use this program. The punch.mp3 sound  |
| isn't included in the repository so    |
| you will have to get your own          |
